##Installation

**YARN**

```javascript
yarn add multer-storage-gridfs 
```

**NPM**

```javascript
npm install --save multer-storage-gridfs 
```

##Usage

The usage is really simple:

```javascript
import multer from 'multer';
import GridFsStorage from 'multer-storage-gridfs';

const upload = multer({ 
    storage: new GridFsStorage()
});
```

**GridFsStorage** listens to mongoose connection **"open"** event. When this event is fired, internally generates a **GridFsStream** instance and it handles the methods provided for multer custom storage.
